# Machine Learning Operations Project

[![Python application](https://github.com/DrJupiter/ML-OPS-FINAL-24/actions/workflows/python-app.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/DrJupiter/ML-OPS-FINAL-24/actions/workflows/python-app.yml)

## Overview

This project, part of DTU's "02476: Introduction to Machine Learning" course, demonstrates tools and practices for organizing, scaling, deploying, and monitoring machine learning models in research or production settings. The main focus is on hands-on experience with various frameworks, both local and cloud-based, to work with large-scale ML pipelines.

The diagram above illustrates the interactions between different parts and services of the project to create the final product.

## Project Goals

- **Objective:** Implement a Vision Transformer Model (ViT) from pre-training (`google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k`) and fine-tune it on the CIFAR10 dataset to make accurate predictions on new data.
- **Deployment:** Serve the model via a FastAPI endpoint, allowing users to upload images for predictions and receive the most likely class with its probability.

## Key Features

- **Q&A Section:** Answers to specific project-related questions are embedded within the markdown file, facilitating auto-generation of the final report.
- **Project Checklist:** Detailed weekly checklist ensuring comprehensive project execution, from initial setup to deployment and monitoring.
- **Group Information:** Specific details about the group members and their contributions.
